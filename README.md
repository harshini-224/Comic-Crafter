# Comic-Crafter
ComicCrafter AI is an innovative web-based application that allows users to transform simple text prompts into fully illustrated 4-panel comics using the power of generative AI. By integrating Meta’s LLaMA 3 language model with Stable Diffusion image generation, ComicCrafter bridges the gap between creative storytelling and visual art, making comic creation accessible to everyone—no drawing skills required.

The system takes a user-written prompt (e.g., “Write a story on Tom and Jerry”) and processes it through LLaMA 3 to generate a structured comic script, including scene descriptions and corresponding dialogues. Each scene description is then fed into Stable Diffusion, which generates high-quality comic-style illustrations in a user-selected art style (e.g., Manga, Sketch, 3D Cartoon, or Realistic). Dialogues are overlaid onto the images using custom-designed speech bubbles.

ComicCrafter AI is implemented as an interactive Streamlit web app that guides users through the process—from entering a story idea to viewing and downloading their final comic as a PDF. The platform offers creative flexibility while maintaining a smooth, end-to-end comic generation pipeline.

This project showcases the powerful synergy of large language models and image diffusion models in the creative arts, and opens doors for new-age digital storytelling, comic design education, and AI-assisted entertainment content creation.
